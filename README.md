A basic remake for the web of the [Soulver App](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) for Mac, made for studying purpose. I've always been fascinated by spreadsheets bindings and the interpretation of sentences written in natural language and soulver-web is my effort in Vanilla Javascript to combine these two inputs. Just type in the blackboard and math operations will produce results in the grey right column.

## Features and TODOs
- [x] Basic styling for numbers, currencies, comments (by writing `@ textofthecomment`) and bold headers (by writing `# textoftheheader`)
- [x] expressions parsing, math functions, variables, assumtions, units (right now EUR, USD and GBP are supported) and math operations thanks to [math.js](https://mathjs.org/)
- [x] binding with rows results (by writing `R and rownumber`) with auto update
- [x] writing `total` in a blanck new row sums the previous results (with auto update)

## Demo
To test things locally just put the the root in a folder to be served by a web server or [check the app online](https://festive-lalande-0b44f6.netlify.com/)

## Bugs
