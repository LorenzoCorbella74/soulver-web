A web remake of the [Soulver App](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) for Mac, made for studying purpose. I've always been fascinated by spreadsheets and the interpretation of sentences written in natural language and soulver-web is my effort to combine these two inputs
For the time being soulver-web supports:

- [x] Basic styling for numbers, currencies, comments (by writing `@ textofthecomment`) and bold headers (by writing `# textoftheheader`)
- [x] expressions parsing, math functions, variables, assumtions and math operations thanks to [math.js](https://mathjs.org/)
- [x] binding with rows results by writing `R and rownumber` and auto update
- [ ] total by writing `total` in a blanck new row and subtotals
